# Feasible-designs-html
This a repo with my first two designs for html, the online version and the folder I started working in and then abandonned.

Drafts contains:
- First draft
- Second draft

Final_Design contains:
- The abandonned project, that I later finished in Final_Design_Online

Final_Design_Online contains:
- The finished project


For both draft designs:
- The homepage page is index.html
- The CSS file is the same, meaning that the CSS file is called main.css
- The example scenario is the same
